                Understanding the Threat Myth: The Real Roots of Anti-Immigrant Fear
                </h2>

                <p class="fs-3 text-center text-charcoal">
                    The “Threat Myth” refers to the false and typically ideologically driven belief that immigrants endanger a nation’s stability, cultural identity, 
                    or safety. Anti-immigrant sentiment in the United States is deeply rooted in its history stemming from psychological, ideological, 
                    and social anxieties. As a result, immigrant communities are targeted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia">xenophobic</a> ideologies. 
                    Xenophobia is fundamentally a fear-based reaction, rooted in early 
                    developmental anxieties, dissociative defenses, and projections onto those labeled as “strangers.” The visibility of racial minority immigrants in the 
                    United States has historically triggered collective anxiety as majority groups externalize fears, losses, and perceived threats onto immigrants

                Behind the Myth: Media Manipulation and False Narratives
                </h2>

                <p class="fs-3 text-center text-charcoal">
                    Media from different eras show how the fears of immigrant ‘invasion’ are recurring issues that are often politically manipulated. These narratives portray immigrants as 
                    responsible for unemployment, crime, and threats to cultural integrity, despite a lack of evidence supporting these claims. Public discourse and media 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric">rhetoric</a> normalize 
                    extreme xenophobic narratives, embedding them into everyday thinking. This normalization occurs when facts about racial minorities are interpreted through what 
                    psychoanalyst <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fakhry-Davids">Fakhry Davids</a> calls a “normal pathological organization,” in which stereotypes and fears are 
                    treated as truth and alternative perspectives are defensively rejected

                    The cost of xenophobic rhetoric can fuel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internalized_racism">internalized racism</a>, fear of deportation, and struggles to balance 
                    cultural pride with the pressure to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation">assimilate</a> among immigrant communities. Political figures describing immigrants as “criminals,” “rapists,” and “terrorists,” exemplifies 
                    how these political figureheads can exploit these fears for power. These narratives operate as self-protective defenses, enabling people to disavow their own fears, projected 
                    aggression, or guilt by assigning them to the “other.” Such language reinforces dissociation, a defense mechanism that allows people to view immigrants as 
                    threats rather than fellow human beings.

                    Anti-Immigration rhetoric often relies on emotions rather than evidence. In a political climate where fear is weaponized, fact-checking and critical 
                    inquiry become moral responsibilities. Truth, grounded in evidence and empathy, is the most effective defense against the lies that sustain racism 
                    and xenophobia. With the increased accessibility of technology, social media has become the main source of news for many. Implicit biases and stereotypes become 
                    “unleashed in rage” during periods of political upheaval, further distancing people from reality and making evidence-based perspective-taking more difficult.

                    Through collective and personal reckoning, society can fight back against false immigrant narratives. The path to healing lies in “witnessing and 
                    resisting injustice,” not in denying it. It requires active engagement, self-reflection, and an ongoing willingness to dismantle the internal and external structures that 
                    sustain xenophobic thought. In confronting false narratives, we must learn to face the truths behind our defenses: fear of loss, guilt about privilege, and 
                    unresolved trauma.
