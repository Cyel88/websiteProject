                Understanding the Threat Myth: The Real Roots of Anti-Immigrant Fear
                </h2>

                <p class="fs-3 text-lg-center">
                    The “threat myth” refers to the false and psychologically driven belief that immigrants endanger a nation’s economic stability, cultural identity,
                     or social safety. Anti-immigrant sentiment in the United States is not based on actual threats from immigrants, but rather on deeply rooted
                      psychological defenses and social anxieties.

                Behind the Myth: Media Manipulation and False Narratives

                <p class="fs-3 text-lg-center">
                    Political Media from different eras show how the fears of immigrant ‘invasion’ are recurring issues that are often politically manipulated. 
                    By analyzing it can be discerned how manipulation of these issues and the spreading of false narratives can affect the general population's 
                    views on immigration and immigrants themselves.

                    The emotional cost of Xenophobic Rhetoric can fuel internalized racism, fear of deportation, and struggles to balance cultural pride with the pressure 
                    to assimilate among immigrant communities. During his presidential campaign, President Donald Trump’s rhetoric, describing immigrants as “criminals,” 
                    “rapists,” and “terrorists,” exemplifies how leaders exploit these fears for power. Such language reinforces dissociation, a defense mechanism that 
                    allows people to view immigrants as threats rather than fellow human beings.

                <p class="fs-3 text-lg-center">
                    Anti-Immigration rhetoric often relies on emotions rather than evidence. In a political climate where fear is weaponized, fact-checking and critical 
                    inquiry become moral responsibilities. Truth, grounded in evidence and empathy, is the most effective defense against the lies that sustain racism 
                    and xenophobia. With the increased accessibility of technology, social media has become the main source of news for many.

                    Through collective and personal reckoning, society can fight back against false immigrant narratives. The path to healing lies in “witnessing and 
                    resisting injustice,” not in denying it. In confronting false narratives, we must learn to face the truths behind our defenses: fear of loss, guilt 
                    about privilege, and unresolved trauma.
